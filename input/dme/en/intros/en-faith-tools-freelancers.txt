Hello everybody!

My LinkedIn profile shows a well overview of my technical skills.

I have a strong background of more than 20 years in IT as developer, architect, analytical, technical leader, team lead, AI projects, IT innovator and entepreneur.

Apart from that I work in these amazing faith-driven projects:

* mysion.co: *MYSION* is an ambitious project, since it has a little community of 350 members, MYSION aims to build a global christian online community kind of social network(yes, I know, it has a lot of challenges but that's the fun of it !!!). Initially it is mainly developed  to spanish and english communities but we intended to be multilingual in the most spoken languages.

* Faith Tech *(FT) Montreal community* : Currently in analysis stage, I joined FT comnnunity some weeks ago, Since I am closer from another FT members that lead FDE groups I am not sure if I will join one of groups led by a FT team member

* *FT Spanish community* : We plan to promote this community once we have experienced FT dynamic with in-person FT communities, it is very curious I founded a verys imilar community to IT spanish speaker professionals, see miees.mysion.com.co (it needs translation on-page to be readen in English)
