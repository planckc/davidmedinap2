Hello everyone,  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  thanks for your time yesterday in meetup, a great time to share experiences and Kingdom vision!

I would like to introduce myself ...


I am a born christian and I hope to be one until I die or until Jesus returns! 🙏🏽

I am a founder and enterpreneur of innovative digital projects in christian communities, currently I am canadian citizan located in Montreal 5 years ago, before I formerly lived in Colombia. 

I have a strong background of more than 20 years in IT as developer, architect, analytical, technical leader, team lead, AI projects, IT innovator and entepreneur.

Currently I have these projects, all on hold:

* mysion.co: *MYSION* is our most ambitious project, since it has a little community of 350 memebers, MYSION aims to build a global christian online community kind of social network(yes, I know, it has a lot of challenges but that's the fun of it !!!). Initially it is mainly developed  to spanish and english communities but we intended to be multilingual in the most spoken languages, technically it is already fonctional, the only thing we are missing are native promoters of each language. Currently we are o hold because we are solving issues about funding, this is my main goal to join FDE, ideas are very welcome !!! 💡

* Faith Tech *(FT) Montreal community* : Currently in analysis stage, I joined FT comnnunity some weeks ago, Since I am closer from another FT members that lead FDE groups I am not sure if I will join one of groups led by a FT team member

* *FT Spanish community* : We plan to promote this community once we have experienced FT dynamic with in-person FT communities, it is very curious I founded a verys imilar community to IT spanish speaker professionals, see miees.mysion.com.co (it needs translation on-page to be readen in English)
