# AI Tinkerers Profile - David Medina

## Introduction

AI Developer & Founder building ML solutions for community impact I'm David Medina, an AI developer with 20+ years in tech, currently applying machine learning to solve real-world problems. I've built production ML pipelines for time-series forecasting, predictive analytics and AI ecosystems using DevOps/MLOps practices (Django/Flask, MLFlow, Azure, GCP). My technical focus includes predictive models, data engineering, and full-stack ML deployment. I have implemented AI systems in various Canadian organizations. In 2022 I founded MYSION.co, a Christian community platform with 350+ members. In 2024 I led a community in FaithTech Americas Online connecting technologists across the Americas to build tech for faith. This year in 2025 I am building SINODE.ORG applying ML/AI to faith purposes.

## Skills

Machine Learning & AI Development (20+ years): Built production ML pipelines for time-series forecasting, predictive analytics with ARIMA-X, LSTM, Random Forest models. Certified Big Data Professional with hands-on experience in neural networks, DevOps/MLOps practices. Technical stack: Python/R, Django/Flask, MLFlow, Azure, GCP, Docker/Kubernetes. Data engineering expertise in ETL, SQL/T-SQL, PowerBI, and Apache ecosystem. Proven track record implementing AI systems at major Canadian organizations including Hydro-Québec, Desjardins, and Intact Insurance.

## Areas of Interest

Claude Code, Multimodal AI, Workflows multiagent to AI Assist-code, RAG systems, and LLM fine-tuning for content personalization. Exploring agentic AI workflows and vector databases for semantic search. Interested in AI applications for community platforms—recommendation systems, content generation, and engagement optimization. Looking to collaborate on projects combining ML innovation with social impact, particularly ethical AI and tools for faith-based communities.

## Projects

SINODE.ORG (2025): AI-powered platform for faith communities—building RAG systems for content personalization, LLM-based recommendations, and multilingual NLP. MYSION.co (2022): Social network with 350+ members, ML-driven engagement analytics. Past work: Time-series forecasting models (ARIMA-X, LSTM, Random Forest) for stock prediction via Meta Trader 5, employee retention ML at Hydro-Québec using neural networks, production ML pipelines with CI/CD automation.
