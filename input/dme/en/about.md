# About David Medina

## Introduction

Hello everyone,

I am a born Christian and I hope to be one until I die or until Jesus returns! 🙏🏽

I am a founder and entrepreneur of innovative digital projects in Christian communities. Currently, I am a Canadian citizen located in Montreal for the past 5 years. Before that, I lived in Colombia.

## Professional Background

I have a strong background of more than 20 years in IT as:
- Developer
- Architect
- Analytical roles
- Technical leader
- Team lead
- AI projects
- IT innovator and entrepreneur

## Current Projects

### MYSION.CO

**MYSION** is our most ambitious project, with a community of 350+ members. MYSION aims to build a global Christian online community, a kind of social network. Initially developed for Spanish and English communities, we intend to be multilingual in the most spoken languages.

Technically, it is already functional. The only thing we are missing are native promoters for each language. Currently on hold while solving funding issues.

### Faith Tech Montreal Community

Currently in analysis stage. I joined the FT community some weeks ago. Since I am closer to other FT members who lead FDE groups, I am evaluating which group to join.

### FT Spanish Community

We plan to promote this community once we have experienced FT dynamics with in-person FT communities. I founded a very similar community for Spanish-speaking IT professionals: [miees.mysion.com.co](https://miees.mysion.com.co)
